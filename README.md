# WORDLE Game

Welcome to WORDLE! This is a simple word puzzle game developed using React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## About

WORDLE is a word puzzle game where the player needs to guess a secret word within a limited number of attempts. With each guess, the game provides feedback to help the player deduce the correct word.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: WORDLE is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the game interface. It's a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and easy customization.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language. It helps catch errors early and improves code maintainability.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can input their guesses and receive feedback on each guess.
- **Feedback System**: The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating which letters are correct and in the right position, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are not in the secret word at all.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface is designed to be responsive and accessible on various screen sizes and devices.

## How to Play

1. Enter your guess into the input field.
2. Press Enter to Submit your guess.
3. Receive feedback on your guess.
4. Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
